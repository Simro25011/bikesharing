# bikesharing

## Overview

We will like to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

Through some vizualations we will showcase with the data available to us :

- The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
